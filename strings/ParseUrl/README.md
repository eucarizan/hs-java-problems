# Parse url

## Description
You want to hack a website now. First, get all the available parameters that you can find in the URL. Then print them in the "**key** : **value**" format. If a parameter doesn't have value, print "**not found**".

If you find the password (parameter **pass**), you should print its value after all parameters once again, but with a key **password**. If a URL does not contain parameter **pass**, do not print anything after the listed parameters. However, if **pass** parameter is present, its value cannot be empty.

**Note**: the order of parameters should be the same as in the URL.
**Advice**: Check examples for better understanding and carefully learn the structure of the URL.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
https://target.com/index.html?pass=12345&port=8080&cookie=&host=localhost

```console
https://target.com/index.html?port=8080&cookie=&host=localhost
